NAME
  set_sv(int newVal, int *status) - set shared_val

DESCRIPTION
  set_sv sets the value of shared_val for the current
  process and returns the value of shared_val for
  the current process. It also passes back a status
  variable that indicates success or failure. The
  status will always be success by design.

PARAMETERS
  int newVal
      -the new value that the current processes shared_val variable
      will be set to

  int *status
      -a pointer to a status variable that is set in the library
      function to indicate SUCCESS(0) or FAILURE(1)

BUGS
  The program does not check if user input creates
  integer overflow.
